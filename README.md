# Replace-Function
A function in Python which replaces all dirty words in a text


SETUP: Install Python 3.8 and set it as an interpreter. Use an IDE or open the terminal and change the directory to location where you
have saved the file. Type python test.py to see the results of the tests.py file.


SPECIFICS: This is a function which hides dirty words in "*". Note that even if the dirty words are in upper case they will be hidden 
by the function. If a dirty word is used in combination with punctuation sign, the dirty word will be replaced but the punctuation will
remain.
